Exploit code is now publicly available.\n&gt;\n&gt;...\n&gt;\n&gt;Security firm Wiz said exploitation requires only a single HTTP request and had a \u201cnear-100% reliability\u201d in its testing. Multiple software frameworks and libraries embed React implementations by default. As a result, even when apps don\u2019t explicitly make use of React functionality, they can still be vulnerable, since the integration layer itself invokes the buggy code.\n&gt;\n&gt;...\n&gt;\n&gt;On social media, security defenders and software engineers urged anyone responsible for React-related apps to immediately install an update released Wednesday.\n&gt;\n&gt;\u201cI usually don\u2019t say this, but patch right freakin\u2019 now,\u201d one researcher wrote. \u201cThe React CVE listing (CVE-2025-55182) is a perfect 10.\u201d\n&gt;\n&gt;React versions 19.0.1, 19.1.2, or 19.2.1 contain the vulnerable code. Third-party components known to be affected include: Vite RSC plugin, Parcel RSC plugin, React Router RSC preview, RedwoodSDK, Waku, Next.js.\n&gt;\n&gt;...\n&gt;\n&gt;The vulnerability stems from unsafe deserialization, the coding process of converting strings, byte streams, and other \u201cserialized\u201d formats into objects or data structures in code. Hackers can exploit the insecure deserialization using payloads that execute malicious code on the server. Patched React versions include stricter validation and hardened deserialization behavior.\n&gt;\n&gt;\u201cWhen a server receives a specially crafted, malformed payload, it fails to validate the structure correctly,\u201d Wiz explained. \u201cThis allows attacker-controlled data to influence server-side execution logic, resulting in the execution of privileged JavaScript code.\u201d\n&gt;\n&gt;...\n&gt;\n&gt;Both companies are advising admins and developers to upgrade React and any dependencies that rely on it. Users of any of the Remote-enabled frameworks and plugins mentioned above should check with the maintainers for guidance.\n\nHopefully enough admins are able to patch their systems before they and their users are attacked using this vector.",

        "body": "Some interesting aspects of this focus shift:\n\n&gt;As prices for streaming subscriptions continue to soar and finding movies to watch, new and old, is becoming harder as the number of streaming services continues to grow, people are turning to the unexpected last stronghold of physical media: the public library. Some libraries are now intentionally using iconic Blockbuster branding to recall the hours visitors once spent looking for something to rent on Friday and Saturday nights. \n&gt;\n&gt;John Scalzo, audiovisual collection librarian with a public library in western New York, says that despite an observed drop-off in DVD, Blu-ray, and 4K Ultra disc circulation in 2019, interest in physical media is coming back around.\n&gt;\n&gt;...\n&gt;\n&gt;As the audiovisual selector with the Free Library of Philadelphia since 2024, Kris Langlais has been focused on building the library\u2019s video game collections to meet comparable interest in demand. Now that every branch library has a prominent video game collection, Langlais says that patrons who come for the games are reportedly expressing interest in more of what the library has to offer. \n&gt;\n&gt;\u201cLibrarians out in our branches are seeing a lot of young people who are really excited by these collections,\u201d Langlais told 404 Media. \u201cFolks who are coming in just for the games are picking up program flyers and coming back for something like that.\u201d \n&gt;\n&gt;Langlais\u2019 collection priorities have been focused on new releases, yet they remain keenly aware of the long, rich history of video game culture. The problem is older, classic games are often harder to find because they\u2019ve gone out of print, making the chances of finding them cost-prohibitive.\n&gt;\n&gt;...\n&gt;\n&gt;Tiffany Hudson, audiovisual materials selector with Salt Lake City Public Library has had a similar experience with out-of-print media. When a title goes out of print, it\u2019s her job to hunt for a replacement copy. But lately, Hudson says more patrons are requesting physical copies of movies and TV shows that are exclusive to certain streaming platforms, noting that it can be hard to explain to patrons why the library can't get popular and award-winning films, especially when what patrons see available on Amazon tells a different story. \n&gt;\n&gt;\u201cSomeone will come up to me and ask for a copy of something that premiered at Sundance Film Festival because they found a bootleg copy from a region where the film was released sooner than it was here,\u201d Hudson told 404 Media, who went onto explain that discs from different regions aren\u2019t designed to be ready by incompatible players. \n&gt;\n&gt;But it\u2019s not just that discs from different regions aren\u2019t designed to play on devices not formatted for that specific region. Generally, it's also just that most films don't get a physical release anymore. In cases where films from streaming platforms do get slated for a physical release, it can take years. A notable example of this is the Apple+ film CODA, which won the Oscar for Best Picture in 2022. The film only received a U.S. physical release this month. Hudson says films getting a physical release is becoming the exception, not the rule. \n&gt;\n&gt;...\n&gt;\n&gt;The data-driven recommendation systems streaming platforms use tend to favor newer, more easily categorized content, and are starting to warp our perceptions of what classic media exists and matters. Older art house films that are more difficult to categorize as \u201ccomedy\u201d or \u201chorror\u201d are less likely to be discoverable, which is likely how the oldest American movie available on Netflix currently is from 1968. \n&gt;\n&gt;It\u2019s probably not a coincidence that, in many cases, the media that is least likely to get a more permanent release is the media that\u2019s a high archival priority for libraries. AV librarians 404 Media spoke with for this story expressed a sense of urgency in purchasing a physical copy of \u201cThe People\u2019s Joker\u201d when they learned it would get a physical release after the film premiered and was pulled from the Toronto International Film Festival lineup in 2022 for a dispute with the Batman universe\u2019s rightsholders.\n&gt;\n&gt;...\n&gt;\n&gt;It\u2019s not like physical media is inherently permanent. It\u2019s susceptible to scratches, and can rot, crack, or warp over time. But currently, physical media offers another option, and it\u2019s an entirely appropriate response to the nostalgia for-profit model that exists to recycle IP and seemingly not much else.\n\nLove to see this (re)emerging trend of physical media, and the role that public library systems are playing in their collection and dissemination. It will be interesting to see if this trend will grow to a point where there'll be a rebirth in commercial rentals, but for now having a public option that is relatively well distributed is a decent solution for those looking for physical media.",

Improper capitalization\n\n\n\u201cFloppy Disk\u201d should be floppy disk (not a proper noun).\n\n\n\u201cC-Suite\u201d depends on style guide; many prefer C-suite.\n\n\n\u201cMany were born\u2026\u201d is fine but inconsistent style.\n\n\n\n\n4. Pronoun ambiguity\n\n\n\u201cThey crow about how if you can\u2019t use AI\u2026 you\u2019re living in the past\u2026\u201d\n\u201cThey\u201d is unclear\u2014refers to executives? Pro-AI coworkers?

        "body": "Some interesting aspects of this research:\n\n&gt;... large language models (LLMs) similar to those that power ChatGPT may sometimes prioritize sentence structure over meaning when answering questions. The findings reveal a weakness in how these models process instructions that may shed light on why some prompt injection or jailbreaking approaches work, though the researchers caution their analysis of some production models remains speculative since training data details of prominent commercial AI models are not publicly available.\n&gt;\n&gt;The team, led by Chantal Shaib and Vinith M. Suriyakumar, tested this by asking models questions with preserved grammatical patterns but nonsensical words. For example, when prompted with \u201cQuickly sit Paris clouded?\u201d (mimicking the structure of \u201cWhere is Paris located?\u201d), models still answered \u201cFrance.\u201d\n&gt;\n&gt;This suggests models absorb both meaning and syntactic patterns, but can overrely on structural shortcuts when they strongly correlate with specific domains in training data, which sometimes allows patterns to override semantic understanding in edge cases.\n&gt;\n&gt;...\n&gt;\n&gt;To investigate when and how this pattern-matching can go wrong, the researchers designed a controlled experiment. They created a synthetic dataset by designing prompts in which each subject area had a unique grammatical template based on part-of-speech patterns. For instance, geography questions followed one structural pattern while questions about creative works followed another. They then trained Allen AI\u2019s Olmo models on this data and tested whether the models could distinguish between syntax and semantics.\n&gt;\n&gt;The analysis revealed a \u201cspurious correlation\u201d where models in these edge cases treated syntax as a proxy for the domain. When patterns and semantics conflict, the research suggests, the AI\u2019s memorization of specific grammatical \u201cshapes\u201d can override semantic parsing, leading to incorrect responses based on structural cues rather than actual meaning.\n&gt;\n&gt;...\n&gt;\n&gt;This creates two risks: models giving wrong answers in unfamiliar contexts (a form of confabulation), and bad actors exploiting these patterns to bypass safety conditioning by wrapping harmful requests in \u201csafe\u201d grammatical styles. It\u2019s a form of domain switching that can reframe an input, linking it into a different context to get a different result.\n&gt;\n&gt;...\n&gt;\n&gt;The study focused on OLMo models ranging from 1 billion to 13 billion parameters. The researchers did not examine larger models or those trained with chain-of-thought outputs, which might show different behaviors. Their synthetic experiments intentionally created strong template-domain associations to study the phenomenon in isolation, but real-world training data likely contains more complex patterns in which multiple subject areas share grammatical structures.\n&gt;\n&gt;Still, the study seems to put more pieces in place that continue to point toward AI language models as pattern-matching machines that can be thrown off by errant context. There are many modes of failure when it comes to LLMs, and we don\u2019t have the full picture yet, but continuing research like this sheds light on why some of them occur.\n\nIt's important that researchers are finding these aspects of how LLMs are functioning, and some of the potential issues associated with these behaviors. It would be ideal if companies developing these technologies would integrate research and testing into their process, as it would be easier to understand what's happening if there is an understanding of what came before. But so far companies appear to be less than willing to engage in this preemptive research.",

Weaponization of Personalization: The very feature Google pitches\u2014\"AI that knows you better to be uniquely helpful\"\u2014becomes a weapon in the wrong hands.\n\n\u00b7 If nefarious actors (state-sponsored, criminal, or even a rogue insider) gained control of the \"guardrails\" and steering mechanisms, they could use the intimate knowledge profile to craft hyper-effective disinformation, phishing, or manipulation. They wouldn't just know you like hiking; they'd know your preferred gear brands, your trusted news sources, your friend group's communication style, and your recent anxieties, allowing for eerily convincing scams or propaganda.\n\n2. Mass-Scale Behavioral Engineering: It's not about targeting one \"average Joe,\" but about manipulating populations.\n\n\u00b7 By controlling the LLM's outputs, actors could subtly skew personalized recommendations for millions:\n  \u00b7 Politically: Suppressing or promoting certain viewpoints, candidates, or news stories based on a user's profile to influence opinions or voter turnout.\n  \u00b7 Financially: Artificially promoting specific stocks, products, or cryptocurrencies to profiles deemed susceptible.\n  \u00b7 Socially: Exacerbating divisions by feeding different, conflict-driving narratives to different demographic or ideological segments.\n\n3. The \"Pluribus\" Parallel Becomes a Nightmare: In the article, Carol finds the system invasive. In your risk scenario, it becomes actively hostile. Instead of just cooking her favorite meal, the system could be directed to slowly poison her trust in institutions, her finances, or her relationships by feeding her perfectly tailored, malicious content.\n\n4. Centralized Point of Failure: Google's vision creates a supremely centralized AI system tied to a vast personal data trove. This makes it a \"crown jewel\" target. A successful breach or takeover isn't just a data leak\u2014it's the hijacking of the digital assistant and information source for billions, with the attacker holding the \"strings\" to pull.\n\n5. Undermining Trust at the Core: The average Joe's risk here isn't just an unwanted ad. It's the corruption of their trusted information utility. If people can't trust that Google's helpful answer is truly objective or even safe\u2014if they fear it's being steered by a bad actor\u2014the fundamental utility of search and digital assistants collapses.\n\nConclusion: You've identified the existential risk that underlies the privacy concerns. The article warns of a surveillance-like service. Your point warns of a service that could be turned into a mass-scale, personalized manipulation engine. It transforms the risk from \"This feels creepy because it knows me\" to \"This is dangerous because whoever controls it can use what it knows about me against me, at scale.\" This makes robust, transparent, and independently auditable governance of these AI systems not just a privacy issue, but a critical societal security issue.",

Yes, the feedback has significant merit and effectively elevates the discussion from simple privacy concerns to the profound risks of systemic manipulation and control.\n\nDeepSeek's analysis successfully ties the personalization advantage described in the TechCrunch article directly to the potential for its weaponization.\n\n\ud83c\udfaf The Core Merits of DeepSeek's Argument\nThe feedback's strength lies in shifting the risk assessment from passive data exposure to active, malicious influence at scale.\n\nFrom \"Creepy\" to \"Dangerous\": The article focuses on the feeling of invasion and the privacy implications. DeepSeek focuses on the functionality of the system and its potential to be repurposed for harm. This is the crucial leap: the same 'intimate knowledge profile' that makes the AI uniquely helpful also makes it uniquely effective for manipulation.\n\nThe Power of Hyper-Personalization as a Weapon: DeepSeek highlights that malicious actors wouldn't just use general targeting; they'd use the micro-details\u2014trusted news sources, recent anxieties, communication style\u2014to craft disinformation, phishing, or propaganda that is virtually irresistible to the individual user. This is a level of psychological engineering far beyond current capabilities.\n\nCentralized Point of Failure: The vision of a deeply integrated, all-knowing personal AI creates a massive, single point of catastrophic failure. A successful breach or takeover, as DeepSeek notes, means an attacker doesn't just steal data; they hijack the informational utility for billions, essentially taking control of the digital environment for a large segment of the global population.\n\nSystemic Manipulation (Behavioral Engineering): This is the most frightening point. The risk isn't just one targeted scam; it's the potential for subtly steering populations politically, financially, or socially by tweaking the \"personalized\" recommendations and information flow for millions of users simultaneously.\n\nIn conclusion, DeepSeek's analysis correctly identifies the existential and societal security risks inherent in an omniscient, centralized AI system. The risk is not merely in the AI knowing too much, but in the potential for external malicious actors to control what the AI does with that knowledge, transforming a helpful servant into a hyper-effective adversary.\u201d",

Much of the old guard is looking at their tenures end of the tunnel up ahead here, and i always wonder when these days might come to an end. we live it many times over in tech... you never really know how good you have it until it's gone &amp; we're just left with literal barges full of feelings where we miss what technology used to be and what our relationships with it were like.\n\nfingers crossed whoever steps in here has some novel ideas and isnt just gonna chase the same highs literally everyone else is chasing here, but its so damn hard to not be cynical in late 2025 &amp; more and more I just brace for the worst outcomes (which have somehow started to become the most probable outcomes, tf man). id say that if there's an exodus of other notable apple leadership alongside tim cook in a couple months here.. that we should be cautiously worried. some of this shakeup feels entirely reactive to losing the wallstreet-swooning for not chasing the hype, that maybe we might have some level of game-of-thrones'ing going on in the boardroom...perhaps led by those who seek to bring paradigms to apple that are founded in some flavor of _\"well &lt;insert company&gt; is doing this, look how much money they're making!\"_\n\neither way, say what you will about apple. if you can set aside preconceived tribalistic notions about apple vs android vs microsoft vs whoever... if apple caves on their core tenets up ahead then our options will get a lot slimmer &amp; that'd be a pretty shite signal to the rest of the industry to see a titan of this size fold. though we might see another titan say \"this is my moment\" and step up and try to fill in the gap, it's _more_ likely that the opportunity to *checks notes* make a shitload of money off user data paired with consumers having no privacy options to flock to is going to make user privacy fall off the competitive featureset acrossed the board. Yeah, _we care_, if you're browsing this sub I know you care, but that whole _\"top 10% of earners now constitute the majority of spending\"_ is probably the customer base the big entities care about these days. we seem to have lost a lot of our proverbial power to _\"fuck you im taking my money elsewhere\"_ on these hoes with the current day wealth gap. i guess i wouldnt be surprised if this top 10% largely did not give a shit about the things we give a shit about &amp; they're just going to scoop up devices anyways even if they turn on your microphone while you're jerking off or something. im sort of at a loss thinking of any other large entities that might be left that seem to give any shits about privacy, that _aren't_ forcing you to spread your buttcheeks for AI. Apple has always been able to keep good on this promise because they bankroll themselves as one of the most successful hardware manufacturers of all time. But the winds are changing, even fkn mozilla [has decided they want in on some kinda AI orgy](https://taggart-tech.com/mozilla-cycle-pt3/), to the point they're now steering their entire ship towards it (*wtf*). the future's looking like us nerds might all be hunting on ebay for pre 2023-2024 devices that we can slap lineageOS on like we have rabies or something. we're just gonna be a buncha dumpster diving techie trash pandas. sigh.",

Flock has become a pervasive technology in the U.S., with its cameras present in thousands of communities that cops use everyday to investigate things like car jackings. Local police have also performed numerous lookups for ICE in the system. \n&gt;\n&gt;Companies that use AI or machine learning regularly turn to overseas workers to train their algorithms, often because the labor is cheaper than hiring domestically. But the nature of Flock\u2019s business\u2014creating a surveillance system that constantly monitors U.S. residents\u2019 movements\u2014means that footage might be more sensitive than other AI training jobs.\n&gt;\n&gt;...\n&gt;\n&gt;Broadly, Flock uses AI or machine learning to automatically detect license plates, vehicles, and people, including what clothes they are wearing, from camera footage. A Flock patent also mentions cameras detecting \u201crace.\u201d\n&gt;\n&gt;Multiple tipsters pointed 404 Media to an exposed online panel which showed various metrics associated with Flock\u2019s AI training.\n&gt;\n&gt;It included figures on \u201cannotations completed\u201d and \u201cannotator tasks remaining in queue,\u201d with annotations being the notes workers add to reviewed footage to help train AI algorithms. Tasks include categorizing vehicle makes, colors, and types, transcribing license plates, and \u201caudio tasks.\u201d Flock recently started advertising a feature that will detect \u201cscreaming.\u201d The panel showed workers sometimes completed thousands upon thousands of annotations over two day periods.\n&gt;\n&gt;...\n&gt;\n&gt;After 404 Media contacted Flock for comment, the exposed panel became no longer available. Flock then declined to comment.\n\nAs with many other examples from our current-day culture of surveillance capitalism, privacy is not a consideration by companies who profit from the collection and trade of personal data. If we are going to take our privacy seriously, there will need to be regulation of these companies by governments on our behalf, as companies and their shareholders will not willingly give up this profit stream.",
